# F. Scott Fitzgerald

F. Scott Fitzgerald, born Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald on September 24, 1896, in St. Paul, Minnesota, was a prominent American novelist and short story writer of the Jazz Age, a term he is credited with coining. Renowned for his lyrical prose, Fitzgerald's literary contributions are exemplified by his masterpiece, "The Great Gatsby" (1925), a quintessential critique of the American Dream during the Roaring Twenties. His works often delved into the complexities of wealth, societal expectations, and the elusive pursuit of happiness. Fitzgerald's life mirrored the extravagance and excesses of the era, and his struggles with alcoholism and personal relationships left an indelible mark on his legacy. Despite facing challenges and limited commercial success during his lifetime, Fitzgerald is now celebrated as one of the foremost American authors, with his writings continuing to captivate readers and scholars alike.
